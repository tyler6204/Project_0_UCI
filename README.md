**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

Q1. Is the std::to_string() function in the standard library allowed for this project?
A1: Yes, the following functions from the standard library are permitted for use in this project:

std::to_string()
std::string::back()
std::string::substr()
std::stoi()
std::append()
std::isdigit()
If you intend to use another function, please ask on edStem for confirmation.

Q2. In part 1, is it required to create a class/struct to represent Node?
A2: You don't have to create a separate class or struct to represent Node, but it's a good idea. If you choose to create another class, it should be internal to LinkedListStack. This encapsulation helps in managing the stack's internal structure effectively.

Q3. In part 1, I noticed that the function prototype for pop() is defined to return void. However, in Zybooks, pop() both returns the value at the top of the stack and removes it from the stack. What is the reason for this difference in implementation?
A3: Good catch! There's some disagreement within the programming community about the best approach for stack operations. In this project:

Separate Operations: The top() function is used to access the top element without modifying the stack, while pop() solely removes the top element.

Standard Library Inspiration: The C++ Standard Library follows this approach, where std::stack::pop() does not return a value. Instead, you should use top() to access the element before popping it.

This separation ensures clear and predictable stack behavior.

Q4. Can I add more functions and variables inside a given class?
A4: Yes, you can add more functions and member variables to the classes as needed. However, ensure that you do not modify the provided function prototypes (names, parameter types/names, or return types) since the automated tests depend on them.

Q5. My memcheck shows that I have suppressed memory leaks. Do I need to worry about it?
A5: No. Suppressed memory leaks typically originate from external libraries, not from the code you write. For instance, the Catch2 framework used for testing might cause certain memory leaks. These leaks, attributed to external libraries and not your own code, will not affect your project's evaluation.

Q6. May I use smart pointers?
A6: Yes, you may use smart pointers such as std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr. However, be aware that the course staff are not required to assist with issues related to smart pointers. It's recommended to use them only if you are already familiar with their behavior and memory management.
